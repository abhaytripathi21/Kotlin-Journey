There are 3 prerequisites functions in kotlin that need to be known before before next step.
1. main function - main function is the entry point of the program. It is the first function that is called when the program is executed.
2. print function - print function is used to print the output to the console. It takes a string as an argument and prints it to the console.
    - In print function we use, print() for without newline and println() for with newline.
3. read function - input function is used to take input from the user. It takes a string as an argument and returns a string.
    - In input from user we use, read() for one character as INT and readln() for with newline.
